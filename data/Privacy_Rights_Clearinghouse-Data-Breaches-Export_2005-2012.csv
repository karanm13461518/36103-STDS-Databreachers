            complied with Visa and MasterCard security regulations less than a 
            year before the payment processor's systems were hacked, compromising 
            up to 40 million credit card accounts. Less than a year later the 
            security breach occurred. Hackers were able to get hold of the data 
            because CardSystems kept unencrypted card information on its servers 
            - in contravention of the regulations for which Savvis certified it. ","Dataloss DB","","2005","32.221743","-110.926479"

It discovered the intrusion mid-December 2006. Transaction data from 2003 as well as mid-May through December 2006 may have been accessed. According to its Web site, TJX is the leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions in the U.S. and worldwide.Note on our total: included in this breach are 45,700,000 credit and debit card account numbers; 455,000 merchandise return records containing customer names and driver's license numbers; recovery of about 200,000 stolen credit card account numbers; records then 1indicated an additional 48 million people have been affected. Totals were estimated at 94 million but now seem to have affected over 100 million accounts.UPDATE  (2/22/2007):TJX said that while it first thought the intrusion took place from May 2006 to January 2007, it now thinks its computer system was also hacked in July 2005 and on various subsequent dates that year.UPDATE (3/21/2007): Information stolen from TJX's systems was being used fraudulently in November 2006 in an $8 million gift card scheme, one month before TJX officials said they learned of the breach, according to Florida law enforcement officials. UPDATE  (3/29/2007): The company reported in its SEC filing that 45.7 million credit and debit card numbers were hacked, along with 455,000 merchandise return records containing customers' driver's license numbers, Military ID numbers or Social Security numbers. UPDATE (4/22/2007): Initially, TJX said the break-in started seven months before it was discovered. Then, on Feb. 18, the company noted the perpetrators had access to data for 17 months, and apparently began in July 2005. UPDATE (04/26/2007): Three states' banking associations (MA, CT, and ME) filed a class action lawsuit against TJX to recover the costs of damages totaling tens of millions of dollars incurred for replacing customers' debit and credit cards. UPDATE (05/04/2007): An article in the WSJ notes that because TJX had an outdated wireless security encryption system, had failed to install firewalls and data encryption on computers using the wireless network, and had not properly install another layer of security software it had bought, thieves were able to access data streaming between hand-held price-checking devices, cash registers and the store's computers. 21 U.S. and Canadian lawsuits seek damages from the retailer for reissuing compromised cards. UPDATE (07/10/2007): U.S. Secret Service agents found TJX customers' credit card numbers in the hands of Eastern European cyber thieves who created high-quality counterfeit credit cards. Victims are from the U.S., Europe, Asia and Canada, among other places, Several Cuban nationals in Florida were arrested with more than 200,000 credit card account numbers. UPDATE (08/31/2007): The U.S. Secret Service Agency earlier this week said it has arrested and indicted four members of an organized fraud ring in South Florida, charging each of them with aggravated identity theft, counterfeit credit-card trafficking, and conspiracy.

The company will give a $30 store voucher to those customers who submit documentation about their lost time and money. And TJX will hold a special 3-day sale with a 15% discount sometime in 2008. The settlement still needs to be approved by the court. UPDATE (10/23/2007): Court filings in a case brought by banks against TJX say the number of accounts affected by the thefts topped 94 million. UPDATE (10/23/2007): The total number of records increased from 167 million to 215 million. Recent court filings in a case brought by banks against TJX say the number of accounts affected by the thefts topped 94 million, up considerably from 45,7 million credit and debit card account numbers initially thought to be compromised. Breach costs have been estimated at $216 million. UPDATE (11/30/2007): Fifth Third Bancorp, the Ohio bank that was fined $880,000 by Visa for its role in the customer data security breach at TJX Cos., the largest ever, also paid fines and compensation totaling $1.4 million following the loss of data from BJ's Wholesale Club Inc. UPDATE (12/05/2007): An InternetNews.com article estimates TJX expenses at $500 million to $1 billion. In a settlement with VISA USA, TJX will pay a maximum of $40.9 million to fund an alternative recovery payments program for customers affected by the breach.

UPDATE (12/18/2007): TJX has settled the lawsuit for an undisclosed amount.Although both sides said the settlement total would remain confidential, TJX said the costs were covered by a $107 million reserve that it set aside against its second-quarter earnings.TJX also has said that $107 million would cover the costs of another breach agreement: a Nov. 30 deal with Visa Inc. to help pay a maximum $40.9 million to help the network's card-issuing banks recover expenses to replace customers' Visa cards. UPDATE (2/10/2008): Notices are going out to millions of customers who may have had credit card information compromised in a data breach. The notices contain information about eligibility for compensation such as vouchers and credit monitoring to be provided under a proposed settlement. UPDATE (4/2/2008): TJX Cos. reached a settlement with MasterCard Inc. in which it will pay up to $24 million to banks and other institutions to cover fraud losses stemming from a massive data breach disclosed last year. They also struck a similar deal with rival card network Visa in which it agreed to pay up to $40.9 million. As in that deal, TJX said the costs of its MasterCard settlement are included in the $256 million the company has set aside to pay for computer work and other costs associated with the breach. UPDATE (5/14/2008): The TJX Companies, Inc. today announced that it completed its previously announced settlement with MasterCard International Incorporated and its issuers.

UPDATE (8/5/2008): Eleven perpetrators allegedly involved in the hacking of nine major U.S. retailers have been charged with numerous crimes, including conspiracy, computer intrusion, fraud and identity theft. This is the largest hacking and identity theft case ever prosecuted by the U.S. Department of Justice. An indictment was returned on Aug. 5, 2008. Conspirators obtained the credit and debit card numbers by wardriving and hacking into the wireless computer networks of major retailers -- including TJX Companies, BJ's Wholesale Club, OfficeMax, Boston Market, Barnes & Noble, Sports Authority, Forever 21 and DSW. The indictments are the result of a three-year undercover investigation conducted out of the San Diego Field Office of the U.S. Secret Service. UPDATE (8/30/2008): TrustCo BankCorp NY sued TJX in August 2008 to recoup costs it incurred from reissuing an estimated 4,000 customer MasterCard debit cards after hackers accessed the TJX computer network. The bank stated its cost for the breach was up to $20 per affected account, explaining that it suffered losses from administrative expenses and lost interest and transaction fees. Later in the month, TJX in turn claimed that Trustco failed to implement policies or procedures that would have enabled the bank to avoid canceling and replacing customer debit cards. UPDATE (9/22/2008):One of the 11 people arrested last month in connection with the massive data theft at T JX Companies Inc., BJ Wholesale Clubs Inc. and several other retailers pleaded guilty yesterday to four felony counts, including wire and credit card fraud and aggravated identity theft. Many of the Internet attacks that he facilitated were SQL injection attacks, according to court documents. The stolen data was sold to cyber criminals in Eastern Europe and the U.S. or used to make fraudulent credit and debit cards. UPDATE (6/26/2009): TJX has agreed to pay $9.75 million to 41 states and to implement and maintain a comprehensive information security program, designed to safeguard consumer data and address any weaknesses in TJX's systems in place at the time of the breach. Of the $9.75 million monetary payment under the settlement, $5.5 million is to be dedicated to data protection and consumer protection efforts by the states, and $1.75 million is to reimburse the costs and fees of the investigation. Further, $2.5 million of the settlement will fund a Data Security Trust Fund to be used by the state Attorneys General to advance enforcement efforts and policy development in the field of data security and protecting consumers’ personal information. UPDATE (7/28/2009): Pennsylvania and 40 other states reached a $9.75 million settlement. UPDATE (9/4/2009): TJX settles for $525K with four banks. As part of the settlement with AmeriFirst Bank, Trustco Bank, HarborOne Credit Union and SELCO Community Credit Union, the Framingham, Mass.-based retailer paid $525,000. The money primarily will be used to cover the banks' expenses in pursuing the legal action.UPDATE (12/15/2009):A Miami hacker who had already pleaded guilty to computer fraud and identity theft for breaches at retailers T.J. Maxx, OfficeMax, and many other merchants, pleaded guilty on Tuesday to similar charges related to breaches at Heartland Payment Systems, 7-11, Hannaford Brothers supermarkets, and two other companies. Albert Gonzalez, 28, reiterated terms of a plea agreement in U.S. District Court in Boston. A week earlier, co-conspirator Stephen Watt of New York, appeared in that same court and was ordered to serve two years in prison and pay $171.5 million in restitution for developing a sniffing program used to grab payment card data in the breach at the TJX companies between 2003 and 2008. UPDATE (3/17/2010): Humza Zaman, a co-conspirator in the hack of TJX and other companies, was sentenced in Boston to 46 months in prison and fined $75,000 for his role in the conspiracy. The sentence matches what prosecutors were seeking. Zaman was charged with laundering between $600,000 and $800,000 for hacker Albert Gonzalez, who is currently awaiting sentencing on charges that he and others hacked into TJX, Office Max, Heartland Payment Systems and numerous other companies to steal data on more than 100 million credit and debit card accounts. Zaman pleaded guilty in April to one count of conspiracy. His sentence includes three years of supervised release with the condition that Zaman must disclose his conviction to any future employer. Upon release, Zaman will not be barred from using computers. Zaman is the second conspirator in the TJX case to be charged. Former Morgan Stanley coder, Stephen Watt, was sentenced in December to two years in prison for his role in the TJX case, which involved supplying Gonzalez with a sniffer program used to siphon card data from the TJX network. UPDATE (3/29/2010): A 28-year-old college dropout who became the world’s biggest credit card hacker on Thursday was sentenced to 20 years in prison for stealing millions of credit union and bank account records from TJX Cos., BJ’s Wholesale Club, Office Max, Dave & Busters, Barnes & Noble and a string of other companies – even as he was working as a $75,000-a-year undercover informant for the U.S. government in identity theft cases. But that’s not the end of it, as Albert Gonzalez is scheduled to be sentenced again to additional years behind bars for additional data thefts at Heartland Payment Systems, Hannaford Bros. supermarkets and 7-Eleven convenience stores. The theft of credit card data cost financial institutions, insurers and cardholders an estimated $200 million, according to law enforcement. JC Penney and Wet Seal were both officially added to the list of retail victims of Albert Gonzalez on Friday (March 26) when U.S. District Court Judge Douglas P. Woodlock refused to continue their cloak of secrecy and removed the seal from their names. StorefrontBacktalk had reported last August that $17 billion JC Penney chain was one of Gonzalez.s victims, even though JC Penney's media representatives were denying it. But the $561 million chain Wet Seal, which has 504 stores in 47 states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico, had kept their identity secret. No more and that.s the way Woodlock wanted it. UPDATE (4/16/2010): Damon Patrick Toey, the 'trusted subordinate' of TJX hacker Albert Gonzalez, was sentenced in Boston to 5 more years in prison. He also received a $100,000 fine and three years. supervised release, according to the Justice Department.UPDATE (7/8/2010): TJX has settled another lawsuit.  The Louisiana Municipal Police Employees' Retirement System, a shareholder of TJX stock, settled with TJX for $595,000 in legal fees and enhanced oversight of customer files.UPDATE (4/8/2011): Albert Gonzalez is appealing his conviction for his role in a
large data breach by claiming that his actions were authorized by the Secret
Service.  The government acknowledged that Gonzalez was a key undercover Secret Service informant at the time of the breaches.  In a 25-page petition, Gonzalez faulted one of his attorney's for failing to prepare a ""Public Authority"" defense, which would have argued that he committed crimes with the approval of government authorities.","Dataloss DB","","2007","42.291762","-71.425895"

The court determined that ""the unauthorized disclosure of personal information via the Internet is itself relatively new, and therefore more likely to raise issues of law not yet settled in the courts.""  The court also found that RockYou.com's privacy policy language, which stated that RockYou.com's servers were secure, did not automatically preclude the plaintiff's allegation that a contract had been breached because the plaintiff alleged that the servers were not secure.UPDATE (3/27/2012): The Federal Trade Commission is alleging that RockYou violated the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act Rule (COPPA Rule) by collecting information from approximately 179,000 children.  A proposed FTC settlement order requires RockYou to pay a civil penalty of $250,000 to settle COPPA charges. In addition to the penalty, the company would be barred from future deceptive claims regarding company privacy and data security, required to implement and maintain a data security program, and barred from future violations of the COPPA rule.","Databreaches.net","","2009","37.485215","-122.236355"

UPDATE (8/27/07):The company first estimated that about 2.3 million records were affected but quickly boosted that number to 8.5 million in filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. A California law firm has filed a class-action suit charging Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) and one of its subsidiaries with negligence in connection with a data breach. UPDATE (11/23/07): A former database analyst at Certegy Check Services Inc., has agreed to enter a guilty plea to federal fraud and conspiracy charges in connection with the theft of data. UPDATE (7/7/08):A man has been sentenced to four years and nine months in jail and fined US $3.2 million for his part in the theft of consumer records from Certegy Check Services. UPDATE (7/7/08): A new settlement provides that all class members whose personal or financial information was stolen can get compensated up to $20,000 if they were not reimbursed for certain identity theft losses caused by the data theft. The losses covered could have occurred from Aug. 24, 1998, to Dec. 31, 2010. www.datasettlement.com UPDATE (4/26/10): As part of a class action settlement in U.S. District Court in Tampa, consumers were given the opportunity to elect credit monitoring for one year or bank account monitoring for two years and were able to seek reimbursement of certain out-of-pocket costs incurred or identity theft expenses. Consumers also were able to request credit monitoring at the company's expense immediately after the thefts were announced. The settlement with the Attorney General's office ensures that Certegy will maintain a comprehensive information-security program. This program will assess internal and external risks to consumers' personal information, implement safeguards to protect that consumer information, and will regularly monitor and test the effectiveness of those safeguards. Certegy and its related entities also agree to adhere to payment card industry data security standards as those standards continue to evolve. As part of the settlement, Certegy is donating $125,000 to the Attorney General's Seniors vs. Crime Program for educational, investigative and crime prevention programs for the benefit of senior citizens and the community and will pay $850,000 for the state's investigative costs and attorney's fees related to the case.","Dataloss DB","","2007","30.332184","-81.655651"

The physical and mental health information included a checklist of 22 different chronic medical conditions that patients did or did not have.  This was without the knowledge or consent of patients and the Attorney General argues that patients had the right to know how their information was being used and to have it kept confidential.Accretive tells investors that its contracts with hospitals include risk scoring patients, reducing avoidable hospital admissions, identifying the sickest and most impact-able patients for proactive management, and identifying real-time interventions with significant revenue or cost impact. The lawsuit alleges that Accretive violated state and federal health privacy laws, state debt collection laws, and state consumer protection laws.  It seeks an order requiring Accretive to fully disclose to patients: 1) what information it has about Minnesota patients; 2) what information it has lost about Minnesota patients; 3) where and to whom it has sent information about Minnesota patients; and 4) the purposes for which it amasses and uses information about Minnesota patients. In addition, the lawsuit asks Accretive to disclose whether it has sent health data about Minnesota patients to an offshore site in new Delhi, India and requests that restrictions be applied to how Accretive treats and uses patient data.The press release from the Office of Minnesota Attorney General Lori Swanson can be found here.UPDATE (08/24/2012): A settlement agreement with Accretive Health was announced at the end of July.  The settlement requires Accretive to stop doing business in Minnesota for two years and to pay approximately $2.5 million to the State of Minnesota, a portion of which will be used to compensate patients.","Databreaches.net","","2011","37.090240","-95.712891"

Michaels Stores released an official statement.UPDATE (05/19/2011): A suit seeks class-action status and more than $5 million in damages for people whose credit and debit accounts were compromised by the breach.  The lawsuit claims that Michaels failed to protect customers from ""cyber-pickpockets"" who stole sensitive banking information from checkout keypads at stores in 20 states. Michaels is accused of knowingly violating federal and state law by failing to take reasonable steps to safeguard customers' personal information.  Michaels is also accused of failing to alert customers as soon as the security breach was discovered. There is now a theory that thieves used a combination of  ""false card readers"", wireless cameras or electronic membranes placed over keypads to collect the PINs and card information of MIchaels' customers.

The lawsuit seeks damages and relief for the inexplicable delay, questionable timing, and inaccuracies concerning the disclosures with regard to the data breach, which is believed to be the largest in U.S. history. UPDATE (02/12/2009): According to BankInfoSecurity.com, the number of financial institutions that have come forward to say they have been contacted by their credit card companies Visa and MasterCard in relation to the breach has jumped from fewer than 50 to more than 200.

Gonzalez, a former Secret Service informant, is already awaiting trial over his involvement in the TJX hack.Total records breached: 100 million transactions per month. It is unclear how many account numbers have been compromised, and how many are represented by multiple transactions. The number of records breached is an estimate, subject to revision. UPDATE (08/20/2009): According to the court document, hackers stole more than 130 million credit and debit card numbers from Heartland and Hannaford combined.UPDATE (05/12/2010): The costs to Heartland Payment Systems Inc. from the massive data breach that it disclosed in January 2009 appear to be steadily adding up. Quarterly financial results released by Heartland last week show that the card payment processor has accrued $139.4 million in breach-related expenses. The figure includes a settlement totaling nearly $60 million with Visa, another of about $3.5 million with American Express and more than $26 million in legal fees. That total also includes $42.8 million that Heartland has set aside to fund proposed settlements with several other litigants over the breach. One example of what the fund is set up for is Heartland's offer to settle several consumer class action lawsuits against it for four million. So far, Heartland has recovered about $30 million from insurance companies.UPDATE (06/02/2010): Heartland Payment Systems has made a third settlement deal, this time with MasterCard, related to a massive data breach two years ago at the card payments processor. As part of the deal, Heartland has agreed to pay as much as US$41.1 million to MasterCard issuers that lost money as a result of the data breach. The deal is contingent on financial institutions representing 80 percent of the affected MasterCard accounts accepting the offer by June 25. MasterCard is recommending that issuers accept the offer.UPDATE (09/01/2010): Heartland Payment Systems has agreed to settle with Discover for five million dollars.  Discover will use the money to cover costs of fraud incidents and reissuing cards.UPDATE (09/19/2010): Jerome Abaquin Gonzales is expected to surrender to police and serve jail time for participating in a credit card forgery ring which used information from the Heartland breach.  The information came from the 4.2 million Discover credit card customers who used their cards at Hannaford Brothers.UPDATE (09/22/2010): Thomas Michio Taniguchi was sentenced to prison for his role in the forgery ring in which Jerome Abaquin Gonzales also participated.UPDATE (12/07/2011): Heartland legal representatives were able to successfully argue that most of the claims against Heartland that were filed by nine banks should be dismissed. All but one claim was dismissed.UPDATE (02/12/2012): The nine banks may have had their claims against Heartland dismissed because Heartland reported that sharing a contractual relationship with the banks defeats their appeal. However, the credit-card-issuing banks are arguing that a New Jersey economic loss rule only bars claims for foreseeable economic losses when the parties are in a contractual relationship and does not bar their negligence claim against Heartland.UPDATE (07/25/2013): Five more foreign hackers were charged for their role in stealing information from Heartland Payment Systems, NASDAQ, Dow Jones, JetBlue, and J.C.

Sony placed an outage to block users from playing online games or accessing services like Netflix and Hulu Plus on Friday April 22. Sony says the outage will continue until the situation is addressed, which will likely be within the next week. Sony believes an unauthorized person has obtained names, addresses, email addresses, dates of birth, PlayStation Network/Qriocity password and login, and handle/PSN online IDs for multiple users. The attacker may have also stolen users' purchase history, billing address, and password security questions. User credit card numbers may have also been obtained. Sony has hired a security firm to investigate the incident and strengthen the network infrastructure by re-building their system to provide greater protection of personal information.An individual filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of all PSN users following seven days of a Sony PlayStation Network outage.  The lawsuit alleges that Sony ""failed to encrypt data and establish adequate firewalls to handle a server intrusion contingency, failed to provide prompt and adequate warnings of security breaches, and unreasonably delayed in bringing the PSN service back on line.""  It also accused Sony of violating the Payment Card Industry (PCI) security standard, which prohibits companies from storing cardholder data.UPDATE (5/3/2011): A review of Sony's network breach revealed that it was larger than first thought. Sony turned the SOE system off.  Hackers may have taken personal information from an additional 24,600,000 user accounts in Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain. Names, addresses, genders, email addresses, login name and associated password, phone numbers and birth dates of SOE gaming customers, as well as data from about 12,700 credit card accounts and 10,700 bank accounts from an outdated 2007 database could have been accessed.  The outdated account information that may have been obtained by hackers includes credit card numbers, debit card numbers, expiration dates, bank account numbers, customer names, account names and customer addresses. The SOE network hosts games that are played over the Internet on personal computers and is separate from the PlayStation network.  Sony has not clearly indicated if credit card numbers were compromised.  At least one report indicates that the numbers were encrypted.  These breached records will not be added to the total until more is known.UPDATE (5/6/2011): Sony now indicates that some credit card numbers were compromised.  Twelve million credit card numbers were unencrypted and could easily be read.UPDATE (5/7/2011): Sony discovered that hackers had placed customer information online.

Wyndham motioned to dismiss the FTC's Arizona federal court case with this assertion.UPDATE (06/25/2014): On June 25th, The Federal Trade Commission ""sufficiently alleged that several Wyndham Hotels entities operated as a common enterprise in the commission's data security enforcement action against them, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey held June 23, in an unpublished opinion. The court is allowing Wyndham Hotels and Resorts LLC a interlocutory review of portions an an earlier April 7th opinion denying the company's separate motion to dismiss, Judge Esther Salas wrote in a second unpublished opion (FTC v. Wyndham Worldwide Corp., 2014 BL 174519, D.N.J., No. 2:13-cv-01887, unpublished opinion 6/23/14)"".UPDATE (12/09/2015): Wyndham Hotels has settled with the FTC that it failed to properly secure customer credit card information. ""A consent order outlining the 
settlement was filed with the federal court in Newark, New Jersey, 3-1/2
 months after the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia said
 the FTC had authority to regulate corporate cyber security.Under
 the order, Wyndham must establish a comprehensive information security

"April 14, 2010","Affinity Health Plan, Inc.","","New York","PHYS","MED","344,579","Under a settlement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Affinity Health Plan, Inc. will settle potential violations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Rules for $1,215,780. Affinity Health Plan is a not-for-profit managed care plan serving the New York metropolitan area.
\Affinity filed a breach report with the HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) on April 15, 2010, as required by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health, or HITECH Act. The HITECH Breach Notification Rule requires HIPAA-covered entities to notify HHS of a breach of unsecured protected health information. Affinity indicated that it was informed by a representative of CBS Evening News that, as part of an investigatory report, CBS had purchased a photocopier previously leased by Affinity. CBS informed Affinity that the copier that Affinity had used contained confidential medical information on the hard drive.
\Affinity estimated that up to 344,579 individuals may have been affected by this breach. OCR's investigation indicated that Affinity impermissibly disclosed the protected health information of these affected individuals when it returned multiple photocopiers to leasing agents without erasing the data contained on the copier hard drives. In addition, the investigation revealed that Affinity failed to incorporate the electronic protected health information (ePHI) stored on photocopier hard drives in its analysis of risks and vulnerabilities as required by the Security Rule, and failed to implement policies and procedures when returning the photocopiers to its leasing agents.
\This settlement illustrates an important reminder about equipment designed to retain electronic information: Make sure that all personal information is wiped from hardware before it's recycled, thrown away or sent back to a leasing agent, said OCR Director Leon Rodriguez. 'HIPAA covered entities are required to undertake a careful risk analysis to understand the threats and vulnerabilities to individuals' data, and have appropriate safeguards in place to protect this information.'
\In addition to the $1,215,780 payment, the settlement includes a corrective action plan requiring Affinity to use its best efforts to retrieve all hard drives that were contained on photocopiers previously leased by the plan that remain in the possession of the leasing agent, and to take certain measures to safeguard all ePHI.

The flooding was so significant that the area was deemed a federal disaster area.  An estimated 1,537 individuals were affected by the loss of data due to flood damage.  The types of PHI involved were names, addresses, dates of birth, and social security numbers.  After the flood, the CE attempted to collect as much PHI as it could from the site but access was limited by authorities because the building was deemed toxic and salvage cleanup commenced prior to the CE's ability to access the building.  PHI in paper format was either washed away or disposed of during salvage procedures.  Computers and equipment in the building were destroyed by water damage.  Because the CE relied primarily on their electronic health records stored on an offsite server, medical data was still intact for continuity of care purposes.  The CE provided breach notification to individuals, HHS, and the media, and posted substitute notice on its website.  The CE has since moved its school-based operations to a CE owned facility.  OCR obtained assurances that the CE implemented the corrective action listed above.

"September 24, 2010","NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and Columbia University Medical Center","","New York","PHYS","MED","6,800","Data breach results in $4.8 million HIPAA settlements
\Two health care organizations have agreed to settle charges that they potentially violated the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Rules by failing to secure thousands of patients' electronic protected health information (ePHI) held on their network. The monetary payments of $4,800,000 include the largest HIPAA settlement to date.
\The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR) initiated its investigation of New York and Presbyterian Hospital (NYP) and Columbia University (CU) following their submission of a joint breach report, dated September 27, 2010, regarding the disclosure of the ePHI of 6,800 individuals, including patient status, vital signs, medications, and laboratory results.
\NYP and CU are separate covered entities that participate in a joint arrangement in which CU faculty members serve as attending physicians at NYP. The entities generally refer to their affiliation as 'New York Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center.' NYP and CU operate a shared data network and a shared network firewall that is administered by employees of both entities. The shared network links to NYP patient information systems containing ePHI.
\The investigation revealed that the breach was caused when a physician employed by CU who developed applications for both NYP and CU attempted to deactivate a personally-owned computer server on the network containing NYP patient ePHI. Because of a lack of technical safeguards, deactivation of the server resulted in ePHI being accessible on internet search engines. The entities learned of the breach after receiving a complaint by an individual who found the ePHI of the individual's deceased partner, a former patient of NYP, on the internet.
\In addition to the impermissible disclosure of ePHI on the internet, OCR's investigation found that neither NYP nor CU made efforts prior to the breach to assure that the server was secure and that it contained appropriate software protections. Moreover, OCR determined that neither entity had conducted an accurate and thorough risk analysis that identified all systems that access NYP ePHI. As a result, neither entity had developed an adequate risk management plan that addressed the potential threats and hazards to the security of ePHI. Lastly, NYP failed to implement appropriate policies and procedures for authorizing access to its databases and failed to comply with its own policies on information access management.
\'When entities participate in joint compliance arrangements, they share the burden of addressing the risks to protected health information,' said Christina Heide, Acting Deputy Director of Health Information Privacy for OCR. 'Our cases against NYP and CU should remind health care organizations of the need to make data security central to how they manage their information systems.'
\NYP has paid OCR a monetary settlement of $3,300,000 and CU $1,500,000, with both entities agreeing to a substantive corrective action plan, which includes undertaking a risk analysis, developing a risk management plan, revising policies and procedures, training staff, and providing progress reports.

"November 18, 2010","Triple-S Salud, Inc.","","","PHYS","MED","398,000","Triple-S Management Corporation (“TRIPLE-S”), on behalf of its wholly owned subsidiaries, Triple-S Salud Inc., Triple-C Inc. and Triple-S Advantage Inc. , formerly known as American Health Medicare Inc.,  has agreed to settle potential violations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Rules with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office for Civil Rights (OCR).  TRIPLE-S will pay $3.5 million and will adopt a robust corrective action plan to correct deficiencies in its HIPAA compliance program, an effort it has already begun.
“OCR remains committed to strong enforcement of the HIPAA Rules,” said OCR Director Jocelyn Samuels. “This case sends an important message for HIPAA Covered Entities not only about compliance with the requirements of the Security Rule, including risk analysis, but compliance with the requirements of the Privacy Rule, including those addressing business associate agreements and the minimum necessary use of protected health information.”
TRIPLE-S is an insurance holding company based in San Juan, Puerto Rico, which offers a wide range of insurance products and services to residents of Puerto Rico through its subsidiaries.  TRIPLE-S has fully cooperated with HHS in investigating this case and has agreed to put in place a comprehensive HIPAA compliance program as a condition for settlement.  
After receiving multiple breach notifications from TRIPLE-S involving unsecured protected health information (PHI), OCR initiated investigations to ascertain the entities’ compliance with HIPAA Rules. OCR’s investigations indicated widespread non-compliance throughout the various subsidiaries of Triple-S, including:
Failure to implement appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect the privacy of its beneficiaries’ PHI;
Impermissible disclosure of its beneficiaries’ PHI to an outside vendor with which it did not have an appropriate business associate agreement;
Use or Disclosure of more PHI than was necessary to carry out mailings;
Failure to conduct an accurate and thorough risk analysis that incorporates all IT equipment, applications, and data systems utilizing ePHI; and
Failure to implement security measures sufficient to reduce the risks and vulnerabilities to its ePHI to a reasonable and appropriate level.
The settlement requires TRIPLE-S to establish a comprehensive compliance program designed to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of the personal information it collects from its beneficiaries, that includes:
A risk analysis and a risk management plan;
A process to evaluate and address any environmental or operational changes that affect the security of the ePHI it holds;
Policies and procedures to facilitate compliance with requirements of the HIPAA Rules; and
A training program covering the requirements of the Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules, intended to be used for all members of the workforce and business associates providing services on TRIPLE-S premises.
Triple-S, with the help of OCR through its technical assistance, had already begun to take extensive corrective action, as required by the Corrective Action Plan, and will continue to work with OCR to come into compliance with HIPAA.
“Triple-S is committed to protecting the privacy and security of its beneficiaries’ health information and implementing the Corrective Action Plan entered into with OCR,” said President and CEO of Triple-S Management Corporation, Ramon M. Ruiz.  “We are pleased with the agreement and regard it as an opportunity to strengthen our privacy policies. We have appreciated OCR’s technical assistance to date, and look forward to our collaboration in the future.”

The CE initially reported that the breached ePHI included names, addresses, zip codes, dates of births, social security numbers, diagnostic conditions and other treatment information.  During the investigation, the CE retrieved the hard drives and laptop and determined that the hard drives contained confidential financial information and business making decisions by the CE, and did not include the types of identifiers (e.g. patient names, Social Security numbers, home addresses, etc.) that could be used to re-identify an individual.  Thus, the CE determined that the theft did not constitute a breach of ePHI.  Further, the CE determined that the laptop was an information technology department laptop that only contained financial data and upper management e-mails.  As of the result of OCR’s investigation, OCR has required the CE to conduct a risk analysis, implement a risk management plan, revise its policies and procedures, and re-train its staff.

"September 27, 2011","North Memorial Health Care","","Minnesota","PHYS","MED","9,497","North Memorial Health Care of Minnesota has agreed to pay $1,550,000 to settle charges that it potentially violated the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Rules by failing to enter into a business associate agreement with a major contractor and failing to institute an organization-wide risk analysis to address the risks and vulnerabilities to its patient information. North Memorial is a comprehensive, not-for-profit health care system in Minnesota that serves the Twin Cities and surrounding communities.
“Two major cornerstones of the HIPAA Rules were overlooked by this entity,” said Jocelyn Samuels, Director of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR). “Organizations must have in place compliant business associate agreements as well as an accurate and thorough risk analysis that addresses their enterprise-wide IT infrastructure.”
OCR initiated its investigation of North Memorial following receipt of a breach report on September 27, 2011, which indicated that an unencrypted, password-protected laptop was stolen from a business associate’s workforce member’s locked vehicle, impacting the electronic protected health information (ePHI) of 9,497 individuals.
OCR’s investigation indicated that North Memorial failed to have in place a business associate agreement, as required under the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules, so that its business associate could perform certain payment and health care operations activities on its behalf. North Memorial gave its business associate, Accretive Health, Inc., access to North Memorial’s hospital database, which stored the ePHI of 289,904 patients. Accretive also received access to non-electronic protected health information as it performed services on-site at North Memorial.
The investigation further determined that North Memorial failed to complete a risk analysis to address all of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to the ePHI that it maintained, accessed, or transmitted across its entire IT infrastructure -- including but not limited to all applications, software, databases, servers, workstations, mobile devices and electronic media, network administration and security devices, and associated business processes.
In addition to the $1,550,000 payment, North Memorial is required to develop an organization-wide risk analysis and risk management plan, as required under the Security Rule. North Memorial will also train appropriate workforce members on all policies and procedures newly developed or revised pursuant to this corrective action plan.

"September 29, 2011","MAPFRE Life","","","PHYS","MED","2,209","HIPAA settlement demonstrates importance of implementing safeguards for ePHI
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office for Civil Rights (OCR), has announced a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) settlement based on the impermissible disclosure of unsecured electronic protected health information (ePHI).  MAPFRE Life Insurance Company of Puerto Rico (MAPFRE) has agreed to settle potential noncompliance with the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules by paying $2.2 million and implementing a corrective action plan. With this resolution amount, OCR balanced potential violations of the HIPAA Rules with evidence provided by MAPFRE with regard to its present financial standing.  MAPFRE is a subsidiary company of MAPFRE S.A., a global multinational insurance company headquartered in Spain. MAPFRE underwrites and administers a variety of insurance products and services in Puerto Rico, including personal and group health insurance plans.
On September 29, 2011, MAPFRE filed a breach report with OCR indicating that a USB data storage device (described as a “pen drive”) containing ePHI was stolen from its IT department, where the device was left without safeguards overnight.   According to the report, the USB data storage device included complete names, dates of birth and Social Security numbers.   The report noted that the breach affected 2,209 individuals.   MAPFRE informed OCR that it was able to identify the breached ePHI by reconstituting the data on the computer on which the USB data storage device was attached. OCR’s investigation revealed MAPFRE’s noncompliance with the HIPAA Rules, specifically a failure to conduct its risk analysis and implement risk management plans, contrary to its prior representations, and a failure to deploy encryption or an equivalent alternative measure on its laptops and removable storage media until September 1, 2014.  MAPFRE also failed to implement or delayed implementing other corrective measures it informed OCR it would undertake.
“Covered entities must not only make assessments to safeguard ePHI, they must act on those assessments as well” said OCR Director Jocelyn Samuels. “OCR works tirelessly and collaboratively with covered entities to set clear expectations and consequences.”

APDerm will also be required to implement a corrective action plan to correct deficiencies in its HIPAA compliance program.  APDerm is a private practice that delivers dermatology services in four locations in Massachusetts and two in New Hampshire. This case marks the first settlement with a covered entity for not having policies and procedures in place to address the breach notification provisions of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, passed as part of American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA).
\
\The HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) opened an investigation of APDerm upon receiving a report that an unencrypted thumb drive containing the electronic protected health information (ePHI) of approximately 2,200 individuals was stolen from a vehicle of one its staff members. The thumb drive was never recovered.  The investigation revealed that APDerm had not conducted an accurate and thorough analysis of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality of ePHI as part of its security management process.  Further, APDerm did not fully comply with requirements of the Breach Notification Rule to have in place written policies and procedures and train workforce members.
\
\'As we say in health care, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,' said OCR Director Leon Rodriguez. 'That is what a good risk management process is all about ' identifying and mitigating the risk before a bad thing happens.  Covered entities of all sizes need to give priority to securing electronic protected health information.'
\
\In addition to a $150,000 resolution amount, the settlement includes a corrective action plan requiring AP Derm to develop a risk analysis and risk management plan to address and mitigate any security risks and vulnerabilities, as well as to provide an implementation report to OCR.

The ePHI involved in the breach included patients’ names, addresses, social security numbers, diagnoses and procedure codes.   The CE provided breach notification to HHS, affected individuals, and the media, and offered one year of free credit monitoring to affected individuals.  Following the incident, the CE hired a private investigator to assist in locating the missing backup tapes; however, they were not recovered.  Additionally, the CE retained Navigant Consulting to assess the recoverability of the information and to conduct a validation review of CE’s internal analyses.  In response to the incident, the CE improved safeguards by encrypting all backup tapes, storage devices, and electronic media that may contain e-PHI, moving backup tapes to a secure off-site facility, installing non-movable storage cabinets in its data centers, and implementing  two-factor authentication for access to ePHI.  It also hired a system administrator to manage and audit backup procedures, retrained staff, and updated and created HIPAA policies and procedures, including role-based access to cabinets containing backup data.

Lahey will pay $850,000 and will adopt a robust corrective action plan to correct deficiencies in its HIPAA compliance program.  Lahey is a nonprofit teaching hospital affiliated with Tufts Medical School, providing primary and specialty care in Burlington, Massachusetts.
Lahey notified OCR that a laptop was stolen from an unlocked treatment room during the overnight hours on August 11, 2011.  The laptop was on a stand that accompanied a portable CT scanner; the laptop operated the scanner and produced images for viewing through Lahey’s Radiology Information System and Picture Archiving and Communication System.  The laptop hard drive contained the protected health information (PHI) of 599 individuals.  Evidence obtained through OCR’s subsequent investigation indicated widespread non-compliance with the HIPAA rules, including:
•Failure to conduct a thorough risk analysis of all of its ePHI;
•Failure to physically safeguard a workstation that accessed ePHI;
•Failure to implement and maintain policies and procedures regarding the safeguarding of ePHI maintained on workstations utilized in connection with diagnostic/laboratory equipment;
•Lack of a unique user name for identifying and tracking user identity with respect to the workstation at issue in this incident;
•Failure to implement procedures that recorded and examined activity in the workstation at issue in this incident; and
•Impermissible disclosure of 599 individuals’ PHI.
“It is essential that covered entities apply appropriate protections to workstations associated with medical devices such as diagnostic or laboratory equipment,” said OCR Director Jocelyn Samuels. “Because these workstations often contain ePHI and are highly portable, such ePHI must be considered during an entity’s risk analysis, and entities must ensure that necessary safeguards that conform to HIPAA’s standards are in place.”
In addition to the $850,000 settlement, Lahey must address its history of noncompliance with the HIPAA Rules by providing OCR with a comprehensive, enterprise-wide risk analysis and corresponding risk management plan, as well as reporting certain events and providing evidence of compliance.

"January 27, 2012","Metro Community Provider Network","","Colorado","HACK","MED","3,200","The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office for Civil Rights (OCR), has announced a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) settlement based on the lack of a security management process to safeguard electronic protected health information (ePHI). Metro Community Provider Network (MCPN), a federally-qualified health center (FQHC), has agreed to settle potential noncompliance with the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules by paying $400,000 and implementing a corrective action plan. With this settlement amount, OCR considered MCPN’s status as a FQHC when balancing the significance of the violation with MCPN’s ability to maintain sufficient financial standing to ensure the provision of ongoing patient care. MCPN provides primary medical care, dental care, pharmacies, social work, and behavioral health care services throughout the greater Denver, Colorado metropolitan area to approximately 43,000 patients per year, a large majority of whom have incomes at or below the poverty level.
On January 27, 2012, MCPN filed a breach report with OCR indicating that a hacker accessed employees' email accounts and obtained 3,200 individuals' ePHI through a phishing incident. OCR’s investigation revealed that MCPN took necessary corrective action related to the phishing incident; however, the investigation also revealed that MCPN failed to conduct a risk analysis until mid-February 2012. Prior to the breach incident, MCPN had not conducted a risk analysis to assess the risks and vulnerabilities in its ePHI environment, and, consequently, had not implemented any corresponding risk management plans to address the risks and vulnerabilities identified in a risk analysis. When MCPN finally conducted a risk analysis, that risk analysis, as well as all subsequent risk analyses, were insufficient to meet the requirements of the Security Rule.
“Patients seeking health care trust that their providers will safeguard and protect their health information,” said OCR Director Roger Severino. “Compliance with the HIPAA Security Rule helps covered entities meet this important obligation to their patient communities.”

The server SJH purchased to store the files included a file sharing application whose default settings allowed anyone with an internet connection to access them. Upon implementation of this server and the file sharing application, SJH did not examine or modify it. As a result, the public had unrestricted access to PDF files containing the ePHI of 31,800 individuals, including patient names, health statuses, diagnoses, and demographic information.
OCR’s investigation indicated the following potential violations of the HIPAA Rules:
•	From February 1, 2011 to February 13, 2012, SJH potentially disclosed the PHI of 31,800 individuals;
•	Evidence indicated that SJH failed to conduct an evaluation in response to the environmental and operational changes presented by implementation of a new server for its meaningful use project, thereby compromising the security of ePHI;
•	Although SJH hired a number of contractors to assess the risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of ePHI held by SJH, evidence indicated that this was conducted in a patchwork fashion and did not result in an enterprise-wide risk analysis, as required by the HIPAA Security Rule.
In addition to the $2,140,500 settlement, SJH has agreed to a corrective action plan that requires the organization to conduct an enterprise-wide risk analysis, develop and implement a risk management plan, revise its policies and procedures, and train its staff on these policies and procedures. The Resolution Agreement and Corrective Action Plan may be found on the OCR website at http://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/compliance-enforcement/agreem....

ACMHS will pay $150,000 and adopt a corrective action plan to correct deficiencies in its HIPAA compliance program. ACMHS is a five-facility, nonprofit organization providing behavioral health care services to children, adults, and families in Anchorage, Alaska. 
OCR opened an investigation after receiving notification from ACMHS regarding a breach of unsecured electronic protected health information (ePHI) affecting 2,743 individuals due to malware compromising the security of its information technology resources. OCR’s investigation revealed that ACMHS had adopted sample Security Rule policies and procedures in 2005, but these were not followed. Moreover, the security incident was the direct result of ACMHS failing to identify and address basic risks, such as not regularly updating their IT resources with available patches and running outdated, unsupported software. 
“Successful HIPAA compliance requires a common sense approach to assessing and addressing the risks to ePHI on a regular basis,” said OCR Director Jocelyn Samuels. “This includes reviewing systems for unpatched vulnerabilities and unsupported software that can leave patient information susceptible to malware and other risks.” 
ACMHS cooperated with OCR throughout its investigation and has been responsive to technical assistance provided to date. In addition to the $150,000 settlement amount, the agreement includes a corrective action plan and requires ACMHS to report on the state of its compliance to OCR for a two-year period.

"August 28, 2012","Cancer Care Group, P.C.","","Indiana","PHYS","MED","55,000","$750,000 HIPAA settlement emphasizes the importance of risk analysis and device and media control policies
Cancer Care Group, P.C. agreed to settle potential violations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Rules with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office for Civil Rights (OCR). Cancer Care paid $750,000 and will adopt a robust corrective action plan to correct deficiencies in its HIPAA compliance program. Cancer Care Group is a radiation oncology private physician practice, with 13 radiation oncologists serving hospitals and clinics throughout Indiana.
On August 29, 2012, OCR received notification from Cancer Care regarding a breach of unsecured electronic protected health information (ePHI) after a laptop bag was stolen from an employee’s car. The bag contained the employee’s computer and unencrypted backup media, which contained the names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, insurance information and clinical information of approximately 55,000 current and former Cancer Care patients.
OCR’s subsequent investigation found that, prior to the breach, Cancer Care was in widespread non-compliance with the HIPAA Security Rule. It had not conducted an enterprise-wide risk analysis when the breach occurred in July 2012. Further, Cancer Care did not have in place a written policy specific to the removal of hardware and electronic media containing ePHI into and out of its facilities, even though this was common practice within the organization. OCR found that these two issues, in particular, contributed to the breach, as an enterprise-wide risk analysis could have identified the removal of unencrypted backup media as an area of significant risk to Cancer Care’s ePHI, and a comprehensive device and media control policy could have provided employees with direction in regard to their responsibilities when removing devices containing ePHI from the facility.
“Organizations must complete a comprehensive risk analysis and establish strong policies and procedures to protect patients’ health information,” said OCR Director Jocelyn Samuels. “Further, proper encryption of mobile devices and electronic media reduces the likelihood of a breach of protected health information.”
Cancer Care has taken corrective action with regard to the specific requirements of the Privacy and Security Rules that are at the core of this enforcement action, as well as actions to come into compliance with the other provisions of the HIPAA Rules. The Resolution Agreement and Corrective Action Plan (CAP) can be found on the OCR website at: http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/enforcement/examples/cancercare.html

"September 14, 2012","The Feinstein Institute for Medical Reserch","","New York","PHYS","MED","13,000","Feinstein Institute for Medical Research (Feinstein) has agreed to settle potential violations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Rules with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office for Civil Rights (OCR). Feinstein will pay $3.9 million and will adopt a robust corrective action plan to correct deficiencies in its HIPAA compliance program; an effort it has already begun.
Research institutions subject to HIPAA must be held to the same compliance standards as all other HIPAA-covered entities,” said OCR Director Jocelyn Samuels.  “For individuals to trust in the research process and for patients to trust in those institutions, they must have some assurance that their information is kept private and secure.”  
Feinstein is a biomedical research institute that is organized as a New York not-for-profit corporation and is sponsored by Northwell Health, Inc., formerly known as North Shore Long Island Jewish Health System, a large health system headquartered in Manhasset, New York that is comprised of twenty one hospitals and over 450 patient facilities and physician practices.
After receiving a breach notification from Feinstein involving unsecured electronic protected health information (ePHI), OCR initiated an investigation to ascertain the entity’s compliance with HIPAA Rules. OCR’s investigation indicated that the following occurred:
•	Feinstein impermissibly disclosed the ePHI of 13,000 individuals when an Feinstein-owned laptop computer containing ePHI was left unsecured in the back seat of an employee’s car;
•	Feinstein failed to conduct an accurate and thorough risk analysis of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all of the ePHI held by Feinstein, including the ePHI on the aforementioned laptop computer;
•	Feinstein failed to implement policies and procedures for granting access to ePHI by its workforce members;
•	Feinstein failed to implement physical safeguards for a laptop that contained ePHI to restrict access to unauthorized users;
•	Feinstein failed to implement policies and procedures that govern receipt and removal of hardware and electronic media that contain ePHI into and out of a facility, and the movement of these items within the facility; and,
•	Feinstein failed to implement a mechanism to encrypt ePHI or, alternatively, document why encryption was not reasonable and appropriate and implement an equivalent alternative measure to encryption to safeguard ePHI. 
The settlement requires Feinstein to establish a comprehensive compliance program designed to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of ePHI that includes:
•	A risk analysis and a risk management plan;
•	A process to evaluate and address any environmental or operational changes that affect the security of the ePHI it holds;
•	Policies and procedures to facilitate compliance with requirements of the HIPAA Rules;
•	A training program covering the requirements of the Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules, intended to be used for all members of the workforce.

"November 5, 2012","Women and Infant's Hospital ","","Rhode Island","PHYS","MED","14,004","Care New England Health System (CNE), on behalf of each of the covered entities under its common ownership or control, has agreed to settle potential violations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Rules.  The settlement includes a monetary payment of $400,000 and a comprehensive corrective action plan. CNE provides centralized corporate support for its subsidiary affiliated covered entities, which include a number of hospitals and health care providers in Massachusetts and Rhode Island.  These functions include, but are not limited to, finance, human resources, information services and technical support, insurance, compliance and administrative functions. 
On November 5, 2012, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights (OCR) received notification from Woman & Infants Hospital of Rhode Island (WIH), a covered entity member of CNE, of the loss of unencrypted backup tapes containing the ultrasound studies of approximately 14,000 individuals, including patient name, data of birth, date of exam, physician names, and, in some instances Social Security Numbers.  As WIH’s business associate, CNE provides centralized corporate support including technical support and information security for WIH’s information systems.  WIH provided OCR with a business associate agreement with Care New England Health System effective March 15, 2005, that was not updated until August 28, 2015, as a result of OCR’s investigation, and therefore, did not incorporate revisions required under the HIPAA Omnibus Final Rule.
OCR’s investigation found the following:
•	From September 23, 2014 until August 28, 2015, WIH disclosed protected health information (PHI) and allowed its business associate, CNE, to create, receive, maintain, or transmit PHI on its behalf, without obtaining satisfactory assurances as required under HIPAA.  WIH failed to renew or modify its existing written business associate agreement with CNE to include the applicable implementation specifications required by the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules.
•	From September 23, 2014, until August 28, 2015, WIH impermissibly disclosed the PHI of at least 14,004 individuals to its business associate when WIH provided CNE with access to PHI without obtaining satisfactory assurances, in the form of a written business associate agreement, that CNE would appropriately safeguard the PHI.
“This case illustrates the vital importance of reviewing and updating, as necessary, business associate agreements, especially in light of required revisions under the Omnibus Final Rule, said OCR Director Jocelyn Samuels. “The Omnibus Final Rule outlined necessary changes to established business associate agreements and new requirements which include provisions for reporting.  A sample Business Associate Agreement can be found on OCR’s website to assist covered entities in complying with this requirement.”
With respect to the underlying breach, on July 17, 2014, WIH entered into a consent judgment with the Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office (AGO), and reached a settlement of $150,000.  OCR found the consent judgment to sufficiently cover most of the conduct in this breach, including the failure to implement appropriate safeguards related to the handling of the PHI contained on the backup tapes and the failure to provide timely notification to the affected individuals. While the AGO’s actions do not legally preclude OCR from imposing civil money penalties, OCR determined not to include additional potential violations in this case for the purposes of settlement, given that such potential violations had already been addressed by the AGO and based on OCR’s policy approach to concurrent cases with State AGOs.  The Resolution Agreement and Corrective Action Plan may be found on the OCR website athttp://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/compliance-enforcement/agreem...
